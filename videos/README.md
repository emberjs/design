# Ember.js Video Projects

Having good videos in the guides and possibly elsewhere on emberjs.com would add an additional dimension to our content. This document aims to outline some possible videos that we could create and hopefully will become an aid to anyone who wishes to create and contribute Ember video content to emberjs.com.

## Shared Resources

We should gather and share reusable videos assets such as sounds, animations and transitions as we produce new videos. Here are some initial resources from the [Ember Inspector video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TMaFhYwC6g):

## Possible Impactful Ember.js Videos

This propsal outlines a set of Ember videos which may be produced over the next couple of months. It would be great if multiple people contributed to creating these. I'm (@gavinjoyce) planning to work on the `2. Getting Started with Ember.js` next.

###  1. Why Ember.js?

This 3-5 minute video will live on the emberjs.com homepage and will be aimed at anyone who might be considering using Ember. It will cover (exact order and content TBD):

- What is Ember.js, what is its mission?
- What are some well known apps built in Ember?
- Ember CLI, Ember Data
- Components
- Routes, URLs and support for the back button
- 6 week release cycle, LTS
- The Community
- Testing
- ES6, SASS and other modern default
- The RFC process
- Emberobserver.com and the Addon ecosystem
- (add more reasons here)

### 2. Getting Started with Ember.js

This 5 min video will live on the emberjs.com/learn page and will quickly demonstrate the main features of Ember.js by creating a simple Github reader application. It will be aimed at technical people who are interested in learning the main features of the framework. It will also serve as an intro to the more comprehensive  "Building Your First Ember.js App" below. It will cover (exact order and content TBD):

- Creating an app with Ember CLI
- Running the app
- Modifying a template, live updating
- Creating a route, loading data
- {{link-to}}, .active style
- Nested routes
- Components
- Addons (markdown, font awesome)
- Testing
- Deploying

### 3. Building Your First Ember.js App

This will be a 45 min videos which will walk through the building of the Github reader app from scratch. It will live on the emberjs.com/learn page. It will be edited to be somewhat fast paced, but it will include all steps made when building the app. This will be aimed at technical people who want to learn how to build an app in Ember.

This will be the first of a set of walkthrough videos, each will tackle a different type of app. Future videos in this series may include a real time app, a Firebase app, an electron app, etc.

### 4. Ember Guides Videos

These will be a series of short videos focused on a particular section in the guides. The topics covered will likely include:

- [x] [The Ember Inspector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TMaFhYwC6g)
- [ ] Routing
- [ ] Templates
- [ ] The Object Model
- [ ] Components
- [ ] Models
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] The Run Loop
- [ ] Addons
- [ ] Contributing to Ember
